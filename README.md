# 🧠 NeuroVision

**NeuroVision** is a growing collection of computer vision tools focused on analyzing human movement, posture, and physiology through video and pose data.

This repository is intended as a modular platform for developing and testing vision-based biomechanical analytics — from joint angle estimation to eye tracking and gait analysis.

## 📌 Current Project

### 🦿 Joint Angle Measurement (`function.py`)

This initial project calculates key lower-body joint angles based on pose estimation data:

- **Knee Flexion**
- **Hip Flexion**
- **Dorsiflexion**
- **Plantarflexion**

These angles are useful for applications in:
- Physiotherapy & rehabilitation
- Sports science
- Motion analysis research
